{"review": "since they are supposed to be rated good for over 600 degrees F, These gloves do make it possible to pull a hot pan out of the oven, and they are marginally more versatile than a regular oven mitt. I was very surprised, since they are supposed to be rated good for over 600 degrees F. , when I could feel significant heat coming through as I pulled a pizza out of my 400 degree toaster oven. Not enough to burn by any means, but definitely more than I expected.
