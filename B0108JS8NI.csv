"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2020",Erin Elizabeth HerbertErin Elizabeth Herbert,yes,yes,Arrived used with poop stains,The diaper arrived used and was covered in poop stains. (See pics) Nothing could have been more disgusting!! I am assuming someone returned it after using it and the company simply did not check the item and then shipped it to us as if it was brand new. These were not small stains either. I was extremely grossed out. Thank god I saw the stains and didn’t put it on my baby! I will be returning this ASAP and I sure hope they check it out when they get it back but I wouldn’t be surprised if they just ship it to some other unsuspecting parent.,1,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718M53+qeBL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815PaxN37CL.jpg",-0,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z2OJ4OISLYHH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108JS8NI,B0108JS8NI,Color: Fish White

My son is 26 lbs and this was incredibly tight and odd fitting at the thighs. He didn't seem to mind but there would be NO WAY we would get any use out of it for more than a few months. I chocked it up to being tight so it would hold poop.Sadly it didn't even do that well. My son pooped and it seeped right out of the diaper (and all over my poor husband that was holding him at the time).Lastly, it touts that it prevents diaper rash. This gave my son the worst diaper rash of his whole life. And we did change him right away after he pooped too.It was also impossible to clean at the elastic leg seams. I had to run this through the wash three times using numerous stain treatments and the poop stain and smell held on. I'm going to soak it in vinegar next.I so wanted to like this, but I don't think I will ever use it again.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2018",BTTL4ever ,-0,yes,Public Health Hazard Alert,"SORRY but babies should not be in swimming pools nor should anyone who has not bathed or showered before entering the water because cryptosporidium and other highly toxic and contagious pathogens are not killed by chlorine or other pool water disinfectants and there is no way to contain pathogens from fecal matter in the ""swim"" diaper inside of the diaper because the pool water circulates through the diaper and out for the general consumption of any other people in the pool. Maybe no one sees the poop the baby releases because they are too young to have any understanding of this bodily function or its appropriate place but there is NO EXCUSE FOR THE PARENTS to pollute the pool in order to prematurely introduce a baby to swimming. Help a child learn to love the water in a small family pool if you like where you can easily ""start fresh"" if they do what babies do. Also a baby is likely to swallow or get pool water in their mouths exposing them to pathogens which there is no good reason to put them in contact with. When they have mastered voluntary control of their bathroom habits, is plenty soon enough to begin to put them in communal bathing situations.",1,-0,-0,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYAYHYBN7K60U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108JS8NI,B01076JRQE,Color: Dark Blue Sea Friends

I like the snaps compared to other products which pull up (don't want to manage a poop while pulling a diaper down her legs :P ) but baby seems irritated when I try to apply the diaper. I have to snap the 2nd to last upper snap and last bottom snap to prevent red lines on her from diaper fitting too tight.
