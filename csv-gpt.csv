"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022",Lisa KLisa K,yes,yes,Horrible,"I purchased this, along with two of the smaller Luna Bean casting kits to do before my mom passed away. This one and one smaller one didn’t work. This just collapsed after it set firmly and we each took our hands out (followed all the instructions to a T), then another kit broke several fingers off even though they weren’t “floating”. We never got to get our family hands together as my mom passed away, but we got my parents holding hands. I’m still trying to fix the plaster in areas where it didn’t capture their hands correctly or parts didn’t come out. And using the plaster set aside for fixing holes and filling in areas like broken finger tips and missing jewelry, the plaster is coming out a COMPLETELY different color than the hands and there’s nothing I can do now. I have photos of the two kits that were just garbage and the useless blobs they set as, and how the one small kit of hands came out. I also took pictures of the barcodes on each bucket.  Since we can’t recast as my mothers passed away, I would like a refund on this and one of my small ones I purchased.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019",Shin. DShin. D,-,yes,Defective,"For step one we measured twelve cups of cool water to the bucket, practiced putting the hands in together a few times then started to add the powder.  As the powder was added it seemed to float on top of the water, and only turned a light pink for a few seconds.  We stirred the powder into the water attempting to ad just 2/3 of the bag. As the powder was mixed in it quickly became grey, then white, and we were not able to stir it with a metal kitchen whisk. We attempted to continue to stir the mixture with a slim wooden paint stick and it seemed to turn to a rubbery texture on the side walls of the bucket but did not absorb water in the center and became clumpy. Although the first step did not resemble the mixture in the videos and description in the instructions we attempted to create a mold holding two hands in the bucket for nearly 5 minutes. After removing the hands the mold collapsed and we placed the bucket off to the side. After a half hour we looked back at the bucket and aggressively stirred the mixture which showed faint pink streaks and seemed to be a more rigid texture. Again we place the hands in the bucket for approximately 5 minutes but the mold collapsed. At that point we put the lid on the bucket and put the bucket in the trash.****we received the refund for this item. *****",Not in violation,No violation of Amazon guidelines,,Not in violation,,,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ha+Es1h5L.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAMD0BX1UV5T8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01E4LWBLQ,B01E4LWBLQ,Size: Couples Casting Kit (2 Hands)

We overflowed the bucket and it went all over the table and ruined a rug - this was fine and added some entertainment lol. A few fingers broke off as we were peeling off the outer layer of the mold - this was fine as we saved some plaster per the directions. We chiseled off as much as possible, it looked clean and aside from the broken fingers - pretty great and we were satisfied. Sat the piece in an area that was well lit but not direct sunlight for it to dry. All seemed well until a few days later.The piece is now molding EVERYWHERE! I emailed the seller and they said to put bleach on it and that should help.
