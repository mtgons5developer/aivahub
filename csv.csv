"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2015",Lowflyer,yes,yes,Excellent value.,"These are well made and are a must-have oil for BBQing or roasting large hunk of meat. They clean up quickly and just make life easy.  If you've tried shredding pork, turkey, or chicken with two forks, it gave you cramps in your hands and forearms like it does me, these are for you.  The grips fill the palms of your hands making them comfortable and almost effortless to use. Highly recommend!",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R306F6Y75SXFPC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L49SKIU,B00L49SKIU,Size: 1 Pack | Color: Black

"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2014",Grimthreeper,yes,yes,best thing ever,In the south we love our BBQ. And no BBQ doesn't mean anything you put on the grill. It's pulled pork off a Boston butt that has been slow smoked to perfection. These are awesome compared to the old way to pulling by hand or a regular fork. Don't hesitate just buy this product. I only wish I would've bought 2 pair.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2015",Amazon Customer,yes,yes,Great for Bear Impersonations,"OK.  Maybe bear impersonations are not your thing, but these pulled pork shredders are just fun to use.  Much sharper than I expected a non-metal shredder could be.  They fit my medium sized hands just fine.  Grip the meat really well.  Paid for themselves the first time they let me pull a Pork Butt off the smoker before my hands even got warm!

"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2015",Jason Goodin,yes,yes,Rip Meat Like an Alaskan Grizzly,"When you want to tear meat apart like a wild, carnal, ruler-of-wild Alaskan domains grizzly bear, buy these. And when you want to just be the hero of the local BBQ scene, buy another pair to share.I tend to rate my convenience purchases in terms of whether the time saved using the convenience item was enough to justify the expense for it. Wow. I easily saved 40 minutes of time shredding pulled pork the very first time using these claws. That's an easy justification of the $15 in itself, let alone the amount I'll use them hereafter. They're such a simple concept, but are done well--good ergonomics, the meat doesn't get caught in the claws, quality construction, and a fair price. I really should have ordered a set of these a long time ago.Perhaps I'll have to order another set and use them as part of a grizzly costume this Halloween. Yup, I like 'em that much.
