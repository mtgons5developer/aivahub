"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2018",Paul Baron,yes,yes,BEST Grill Brush ever!,"The media could not be loaded.                  **UPDATED 8/21/18** After using this for a few months now I figured I'd do a quick video on it because I love it so much. This has actually become a go-to ""have you heard of this?"" item. Seriously if you haven't gotten this for yourself or any other grill masters you know in your life you need to.This is a FANTASTIC grill brush!! I remember seeing something on Facebook a while back about how the normal bristle grill brushes shouldn't be used in your food because the bristles fall off on the grill and can contaminate your food and I thought, ""Yeah right, I've NEVER seen that and I'd totally know if that happened..."" Well, that was last summer, end of BBQing season, fast-forward to a couple weeks ago... My wife bought me an awesome new smoker for Father's day and as I was cleaning it with my old and trusty bristle brush from the old propane grill, I noticed that the bristles WERE falling off!Anyway, after finding them stuck to the sides of my new grill grates I decided that I needed a shiny new bristle free grill brush to go with my amazing new smoker. Found this on Amazon and heard about it from some other BBQing experts as THE company to go with- they also make pulled pork claws which are amazing (I've heard), everyone I talked to raved about the quality and customer service. They were definitely right. This thing is SUPER well-made and very easy to use and does a way, way better job of cleaning my grill than that junky bustle brush did. I love how the coils can either be used to scrape along the tops of the grates or when you turn the brush slightly sideways you can clean the sides as they fit really well down the sides that way. Great, great grill brush.It's seems silly to say, but I'm pretty excited about my new brush almost as much as I am about my new smoker. Ok who am I kidding, new smoker is definitely #1... but I've been telling everyone about this brush, for real. Stop using a bristle brush and go with this guy, the company that makes it is a small family company- per their stuff on the box and website so I feel good about supporting them and they really make a top-knotch product.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IW5X5WLLXBK3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CKHWWX1,-,-

It may work for other grills, but definitely not mine. I have a Weber Spirit with triangle grills (flat bottom, triangle top). It just did not dig out the food remnants and clean thoroughly like a wire brush does.  I would put so much pressure on the brush and it would still not clean the grates; it left lots of remnants behind.It's a great idea with the stainless steel coils, but a better design would have been better so it can dig down and really scrape off the remnants with little effort.",1,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WKIO80K0KPMZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CKHWWX1,-,-
"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019",CallMeChaz,yes,yes,This is a better configuration for this style brush.,"I like that the three brush heads are aligned parallel to the handle, as opposed to the type that are 90 degrees to the handle. I tried the latter on round bar grates and cast iron grates and it was worthless. The heads on either brush are formed by spirals of stainless steel coils. On this brush, the individual coils are aligned so they scrape crud cross-wise from the grates on each stroke (assuming you are brushing parallel to your grate openings). The other brushes align the coil windings so they just glide along the bar with no scraping action.Also, the brush is very heavily made, and looks like it will last a good while. It will definitely outlast he bristle type, and will not be leaving metal bits in my food!",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXMFYDACBLFLT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CKHWWX1,-,-

After researching the ingredients on so many ""natural"" or ""organic"" products that I already owned, I was really shocked to find out what was in them.  Many of them that were certified organic by USDA contained known carcinogens as well as other nasty chemicals.  I checked out each ingredient that goes into this product, I can say that I have finally found a dish soap that I can trust.  We will no longer be drinking from cups and eating from plates and silverware that have been washed with ingredients that are capable of causing cancer.  I am also happy that this product is safe for our septic and waterways.  I will say that the price seemed very steep for an 8oz bottle of soap, but a little bit of this stuff goes a LONG way.  Just a couple of drops washed an entire sink full of dishes.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how well just a few drops in the dishwasher did.If you are using another ""natural"" dish soap, I would recommend that you research all of the ingredients.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2018",MAP,yes,yes,Best non-toxic detergent ever for the dishwasher!,"This is the best detergent we’ve ever used! We purchased it after using several “natural” brands. I was discouraged with paying a lot of money for a non-toxic detergent, not getting clean dishes, and having the formerly shiny stainless steel flatware come out of the dishwasher tarnished. I even ended up buying a bottle of a super toxic, mass produced brand to alternate between a popular natural detergent. The dishes came out cleaner, but they were dull and hazy and the glasses were always spotted. I couldn’t stand the lingering toxic smell on them. I had to rinse every dish, glass, pot, plate, and piece of silverware silverware to get the residue off before using them.The first thing I noticed about this product is how good it smells. I am sensitive to synthetic fragrances and can only tolerate pure essential oils. Citrus oils are my favorite, and after opening the bottle I couldn’t stop smelling it. My husband was laughing at me and finally grabbed it and said it smelled great, and I had to fight to get it back!We followed the directions and used just a teaspoon in the machine. I’ll admit we were skeptical that such a small amount would work, but we have never seen such clean dishes.The plates were completely spotless and shiny without any dried food stuck to them, and the  glasses came out shiny and clear without looking hazy or spotted - not even one spot! I don’t know how it happened, but we put our dingy, spotted jelly jar drinking glasses in and they came out looking like we just bought them!The glass jars we use to store food in the refrigerator also came out perfectly clean. I was worried about those because they’re always greasy and they go on the top shelf. Not only did the product clean them, but now they look brand new!The stainless steel pots and pans came out shiny and bright, and even the silverware (that had been badly tarnished by a popular “natural” dishwashing detergent) began to look better. I’m sure that it will be restored to its natural look with a few washings.After using upwards of ten different brands over a span of several years and being consistently dissatisfied, we have finally found the perfect non-toxic dish detergent and will never use another brand!",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C6508GRRX13R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0711WHLCQ,-,-
"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2018",customer,yes,yes,Question safety of essential oil left after final rinse,"My main concern is the residual smell of the essential oils left on plastics and silicone straws, inside the sprayer arms, and especially the detergent dispenser. To me that translates to:  there must be essential oil left behind.  Are essential oils of lemon and lime safe for children and babies?  There is some controversy.  I am confident the dishwasher was not at fault for lemon-lime smell..  Also, essential oils dissolve plastics.  It makes me wonder if the oils are dissolving the product container - that appears to be plastic - and perhaps plastic should be part of the ingredient list . What is the effect of this product on plastic parts within the dishwasher?  The plasticware and silicone were suppose to be dishwasher safe. Perhaps no plastic or silicone should be washed in dishwasher.As to the effectiveness of cleaning, I was not impressed.  It could be because I only used 1/2 tsp. product as suggested by some reviewers also other reviewers mentioned the smell. I am glad I only used that amount.  Imagine that the smell would have been even more pronounced. The container recommends 1 tsp. For good cleaning results, I would also recommend that amount.

After seeing the slow melt of my previous set of oven mitts, I purchased the Ove Glove.  It did not work.  At temperatures of about 500 degrees of higher, the heat passed through the glove to my hand as if it was not there at all.So I bought these.  And now that I've tried them at 550 degrees, I can verify that they work at least to that temperature.  I can't test them at their maximum temperature of 660 degrees because my ovens maximum temperature is 550.  But I am very pleased that I can now cook at that temperature without melting my oven mitts or burning my hand.My only complaint is about the gloves' size.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2015",D. L.,yes,yes,Fabulous and Reasonably Priced,"Since purchasing a pair of Ove Gloves many years ago, I rarely use pot holders or pot mits anymore.  The old pot holders are used as trivets or I lay them on lids to keep from getting burned when I have to check stovetop, covered pots.I feel very lucky to have acquired this set of gloves at a terrific price.  They are fabulous.  Even the regular Amazon price is a great bargain.They can be laundered when they need it and are likely to last for many years.They are well sized and should fit anyone who doesn't have extremely small or extremely large hands.The ability to really have a grip on hot pans, while protecting your hands and wrists is great.  The silicone stripes increase the heat protection and the ability to have a firm hold on objects.  Being able to use all of your fingers independently really makes a difference.I bake bread off and on and can excess produce from the garden.  I rely on this type of oven gloves for both tasks.  No more burning your wrist on an oven grate when inserting or removing a pan.  It's wonderful to have a secure grip on heavy hot pans and not feel like you have to race to set them down or risk dropping them.I have other types of oven pads and mits, but always grab the gloves when I have to move a hot pan.  The other types just can't do the job as well or provide the level of protection that these gloves do.Like any fabric based product, you have to avoid getting them wet or you will get burned.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CJJG9O3IP60J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFJNVTS,-,-

They were either uncomfortable or awkward.  After using the Kitchen Ready SafeGrip Gloves, I was surprised from the time I slipped them on.  First, using the gloves on each hand felt secure and I was able to put both hands on the oven racks as well as the pan, dish or my favorite cast iron Dutch Oven.  Most importantly,  heat was not an issue.  After cooking in my Dutch Oven at 450 degrees, I held on to it for two minutes and could feel no heat coming through the gloves.

Only used a few times to date, but so far, very well insulated.  We like how they can withstand a lot of heat, but have not tested the highest temp yet.  For our normal cooking temps (350-450 degrees F) these are perfect and you can hardly feel any heat coming through.  I also like how there is a little length of protection for your wrists - a lot of pot holders, etc will expose your skin right at the points where you're vulnerable in getting burned as you take things out from the top level of the oven/rearrange the tiers within the oven.  Overall, worth paying a bit more up front for mitts that will (hopefully) last for a long time and protect your hands AND wrists!",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19R8YU03K0K2O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFJNVTS,-,-

Derr,yes,yes,Fabulous solution to accidental burns or difficulty gripping hot things,"I've had a pair of these gloves for years and would not go 2 days without a pair - I would have to re-order immediately if something happened to them because I love them so much.  So, I bought a pair for a friend as a Christmas gift because she keeps burning herself while baking things in the oven.  She thought I was over-reacting to suggest that she get a pair.  She's eating her words since I gave her a pair.  She loves them too.  Most of us are too stressed and hurried in the kitchen to ""just be careful"" with regular pot holders.  Other quilted gloves do not keep out the heat.  These gloves prevent the burns on the back of the hands, wrists - those places that we don't attend to when pulling out the tray of cookies or the casserole dish.  They also allow for more tightly gripping heavy dishes going in and out of the oven.  No kitchen should be without a pair.  Also bought a pair for my daughter last Christmas and got her converted to Oven Gloves also. I also put candle holders in the oven on 200 degrees to clean out the last of the wax (on top of a used piece of aluminum foil).  These gloves are very helpful gripping that type of container while I wipe it out with paper towel to start with a new candle.
