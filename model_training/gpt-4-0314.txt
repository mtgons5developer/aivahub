High temperature gloves that work! I do some high temperature cooking.  After seeing the slow melt of my previous set of oven mitts, I purchased the Ove Glove.  It did not work.  At temperatures of about 500 degrees of higher, the heat passed through the glove to my hand as if it was not there at all.So I bought these.  And now that I've tried them at 550 degrees, I can verify that they work at least to that temperature.  I can't test them at their maximum temperature of 660 degrees because my ovens maximum temperature is 550.  But I am very pleased that I can now cook at that temperature without melting my oven mitts or burning my hand.My only complaint is about the gloves' size.  I have medium sized hands for a woman and these gloves seem made for a large man's hands.  That won't stop me from using them.  But they look enormous on me and they feel decidedly oversized.
High quality and a decent enough fit for small hands I purchased these gloves as a gift for my mother, and she absolutely loves them. She reports that they work perfectly to protect her hands and wrists from high heat. As I searched for the right pair, the challenge was sizing. So many of these kinds of gloves are quite large, and many of the smaller pairs on Amazon do not receive great reviews. I chose the KitchenReady gloves because people seemed generally satisfied with the size, and my mom, who has small hands, concurs. They don't fit small hands snugly, but they fit comfortably enough to maintain good dexterity. So it's a win-win!
Super high quality!!! Super high quality. Thick, but not too thick. Snug but not too snug making a very secure grip on objects. Gloves fit great and work well.  I would highly recommend these safe non-slip grip extreme heat resistant oven/grilling gloves.  I also like that the KitchenReady company followed up with me via email to make sure I was satisfied with my product.
Awesome Heat Resistant Cooking/Grilling Gloves These gloves were a great find.  Great for simply taking pots and pans from the oven or stove.  We have also found them to be very handy outdoors when grilling or around the campfire.  These heat resistant gloves give you better grip on almost any hot object and of course provide the safety from burning your hands.  I would recommend a pair in the kitchen and a pair for outside. Don't wait once you have a pair you will wonder what you did without them.
Fabulous and Reasonably Priced Since purchasing a pair of Ove Gloves many years ago, I rarely use pot holders or pot mits anymore.  The old pot holders are used as trivets or I lay them on lids to keep from getting burned when I have to check stovetop, covered pots.I feel very lucky to have acquired this set of gloves at a terrific price.  They are fabulous.  Even the regular Amazon price is a great bargain.They can be laundered when they need it and are likely to last for many years.They are well sized and should fit anyone who doesn't have extremely small or extremely large hands.The ability to really have a grip on hot pans, while protecting your hands and wrists is great.  The silicone stripes increase the heat protection and the ability to have a firm hold on objects.  Being able to use all of your fingers independently really makes a difference.I bake bread off and on and can excess produce from the garden.  I rely on this type of oven gloves for both tasks.  No more burning your wrist on an oven grate when inserting or removing a pan.  It's wonderful to have a secure grip on heavy hot pans and not feel like you have to race to set them down or risk dropping them.I have other types of oven pads and mits, but always grab the gloves when I have to move a hot pan.  The other types just can't do the job as well or provide the level of protection that these gloves do.Like any fabric based product, you have to avoid getting them wet or you will get burned.
Superb quality gloves These gloves are really amazing!  I ordered them for my parents as they do a lot of grilling and my dad can use them when he's starting a fire in the fireplace. I like the feeling of these gloves and I am glad that they are not the silicone gloves those are really uncomfortable to wear.we are very happy with the quality of these gloves and the customer service of KitchenReady.
Work far better than the normal mitts Work far better than the normal mitts.  basically held onto a 550° pizza stone for half a minute with no heat felt whatsoever.
I have never enjoyed using hot pads or oven mitts I have never enjoyed using hot pads or oven mitts.  They were either uncomfortable or awkward.  After using the Kitchen Ready SafeGrip Gloves, I was surprised from the time I slipped them on.  First, using the gloves on each hand felt secure and I was able to put both hands on the oven racks as well as the pan, dish or my favorite cast iron Dutch Oven.  Most importantly,  heat was not an issue.  After cooking in my Dutch Oven at 450 degrees, I held on to it for two minutes and could feel no heat coming through the gloves.  Another great product!
As advertised, fits both male and female hands - great product! Great product. Only used a few times to date, but so far, very well insulated.  We like how they can withstand a lot of heat, but have not tested the highest temp yet.  For our normal cooking temps (350-450 degrees F) these are perfect and you can hardly feel any heat coming through.  I also like how there is a little length of protection for your wrists - a lot of pot holders, etc will expose your skin right at the points where you're vulnerable in getting burned as you take things out from the top level of the oven/rearrange the tiers within the oven.  Overall, worth paying a bit more up front for mitts that will (hopefully) last for a long time and protect your hands AND wrists!
Perfect for handling hot charcoal. I bought these Kitchen Ready gloves so I could move red hot coals when cooking with my Big Green Egg. They are absolutely ideal for stacking and rearranging coals. I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes to cook with a smoker.
WE THINK YOU WILL LIKE THESE. These oven gloves are just what we wanted. They offer more protection and "feel" than the mitten style we have had. Also, the strength of grip you have with these give you more security.
Another great product - and Dad loves them! I've used the KitchenReady meat claws (love them!) so I thought I'd give these oven gloves a try.  The gloves are also great! They really do keep the heat out.  I gave a pair to my Dad, who like most men enjoys grilling, and he's also a fan of the gloves.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I wish they offered a smaller size versus the universal size.  While my Dad says they fit him great, I'd prefer them a little more snug.  Regardless, these gloves deserve at least 4 stars and I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a quality pair of heat resistant oven gloves!
Burnt the cookies not my Hands!! Wonderful!! Got these as a gift from my mother. I was scared at first to hold on to the pan longer than a quick transfer because the fabric felt so thin!! But was amazed at the protection and the flexibility of these puppies! Completely retiring my old oven gloves for these!! Super protective and you can get a good grip with all 5 fingers:)
Practical, flexible gloves When I first received the gloves I thought that they would be too big for my small hands. It turns out that they are very soft and flexible, conforming to my hands. I can easily grab hot dishes, baked potatoes, etc., and hold items securely without fear of heat coming through. And they fit my husband's larger hands as well. Very practical.
These gloves certainly protect from the heat... ... These gloves certainly protect from the heat...when dry.  When you get them wet prepare for a steam bath!  Also, they tend to run a bit small.
They are amazing! I have had the privilege to try the kitchen ready safe grip gloves. They are a must have for anyone that cooks, bakes, or grills. They protect your entire hands top and bottom through wrists. They are amazing!
Not as good as an Ove Glove I used an Ove Glove for what seemed to be forever, but it finally wore out.  I ordered this hoping for the best, but it was not to be.  It's not bad, but I can hold a hot item for only about half as long as my old Ove Glove.  If I hadn't the experience with the Ove Glove I might have given it four or even five stars.  It does the job just fine; just not as well.
since they are supposed to be rated good for over 600 degrees F These gloves do make it possible to pull a hot pan out of the oven, and they are marginally more versatile than a regular oven mitt. I was very surprised, since they are supposed to be rated good for over 600 degrees F. , when I could feel significant heat coming through as I pulled a pizza out of my 400 degree toaster oven. Not enough to burn by any means, but definitely more than I expected. Since I have them now, I will continue to use them, but in general, I would say they are not enough better than a conventional oven mitt to justify the cost.
"Yes I still love my kitchen ready safe grip gloves they are much better I love my Kitchen ready safe grip heat resistant gloves What can I say I love the safe grip resistant gloves they are everything they say they are delivery took a little longer than I wanted but it was worth the wait.Can the gloves withstand 662 degree F I don't know and I don't want to find out I had the oven at 450 and reached in and pulled a pan out and it was not hot so that is hot enough for me.Thank you Kitchen Ready
worth the money Love the gloves. They are going to be wonderful gifts. They make it so easy to bake, no more burning my hands or arms. Thank you for a great product.
but love them so far Have only used these 3 times, but love them so far.  They are much better than trying to use hot pads or bulky big hot mitts.
Excellent customer service with fast shipping Excellent customer service with fast shipping. Gloves work great with not allowing the heat touch your fingers inside. Highly recommended !!!
Five Stars Love them! Great for the grill and campfires!
They Work, Period! The media could not be loaded.                  Fit was great and they passed all the Squatch TV tests with flying colors!I tested on a 525° cookie sheet straight out of the oven and held it for about a minute with no problem at all. Then I went out and grabbed a charcoal briquette which are 800°-1000° and didn’t have any problems with that either.I would have no problem letting my children use these when cooking and feel 100% sure that they would be safe!Buy yourself a pair and you’ll be happy you did!
Throw away your pot holders and oven mitts! I have always use "old school" pot holders.  Which are ineffective, and even dangerous if the pot slips, or your wrist bangs the hot shelf.  I never considered a glove.  And I have been skeptical these lightweight gloves could really work as well as an oven mitt.  I was very wrong!  These are extraordinary!  They are flexible and lightweight and keep your fingers nimble and available to balance a hot dish or cookie sheet - unlike pot holders or oven mitts.  I have thrown away my tired, old pot holders and oven mitts.  And have ordered a second pair to use when grilling!

I've used these safe grip gloves several times since I received them and have been extremely pleased.  The gloves are comfortable and form fitting to allow you to pick up and grab items with ease.  Around the grill most times I leave one on until I'm completed.  Having a pair comes in handy around the oven, especially if your roasting pans are like mine with hard to grab handles.  The gloves are made of a very think and durable material,  you will definitely have no doubt when using them.

When I saw this pair it was a "must have" for me.  It makes taking items from the oven much safer.  I can take a turkey out of the oven without worrying about getting burned. Does resist the heat!!!! Makes an excellent mother's day gift.
Great packaging, great product and great customer service Great packaging, great product and great customer service. Now all I have to do is find time to use them!
Fabulous solution to accidental burns or difficulty gripping hot things I've had a pair of these gloves for years and would not go 2 days without a pair - I would have to re-order immediately if something happened to them because I love them so much.  So, I bought a pair for a friend as a Christmas gift because she keeps burning herself while baking things in the oven.  She thought I was over-reacting to suggest that she get a pair.  She's eating her words since I gave her a pair.  She loves them too.  Most of us are too stressed and hurried in the kitchen to "just be careful" with regular pot holders.  Other quilted gloves do not keep out the heat.  These gloves prevent the burns on the back of the hands, wrists - those places that we don't attend to when pulling out the tray of cookies or the casserole dish.  They also allow for more tightly gripping heavy dishes going in and out of the oven.  No kitchen should be without a pair.  Also bought a pair for my daughter last Christmas and got her converted to Oven Gloves also. I also put candle holders in the oven on 200 degrees to clean out the last of the wax (on top of a used piece of aluminum foil).  These gloves are very helpful gripping that type of container while I wipe it out with paper towel to start with a new candle.  Can't imagine that anyone would ever regret a purchase of these.
One size may fit all, but fits some better I really like these gloves, I've only used them a couple of times so far, but both times in fairly high heat situations. I haven't used them yet for my hottest recipe (pan pizza at 550) but I will make sure to update if they aren't completely satisfactory at that point. My only complaint is that I have medium-small woman's hands and these feel a little clunky. They fit my husband perfectly and are totally useable for me, but are not ideal. The extra fabric bunched today when I was handling my dutch oven and I was afraid for a moment I was going to drop it. It might just take more practice to grip easily, but if they came out with a ladies size, we would definitely buy a second pair!
I highly recommend these gloves These gloves are so helpful. They protect my hands and wrists while handling pans in the oven or on the grill. They allow me to have a firm grip on whatever I am cooking.  A must have for every cook.  I highly recommend these gloves.
I love them and so do my co-workers I use them at work. I love them and so do my co-workers. They work great for pulling things out of the steamer, and oven.
They arrived on time and the People we have it seem to like them. Gave these as a Gift. They arrived on time and the People we have it seem to like them.
Very Happy with Purchase We are very happy with our recent purchase of Safe Grip oven gloves. The silicon grip strips are a great idea, and I love having fingers free to move rather than being stuck in a mitt.
good and bad. I had high hopes for this oven glove but taking a batch of cookies out hurt my hand. The company was kind enough to send another pair. They were very accommodating.
... a lot of cooking and baking and these are great! do a lot of cooking and baking and these are great!
These are so much better than regular hot pads or oven mitts that there ... I bought five pairs for family members.  These are so much better than regular hot pads or oven mitts that there is no comparison.  Highly recommended for anyone who cooks.
Haven't used them but they feel good wish I had order the mittens Haven't used them but they feel good.
Five Stars Comfortable fit, the silicone grips are excellent and do give you more stability when removing something with one hand.
Great oven glove product We love the gloves, heat resistance is great, perfect for us. Use them daily.
These are without doubt the BEST oven gloves I have ever had Theseare without doubt the BEST oven gloves I have ever had.
must have in the kitchen Love them use them every day
Four Stars They work well removing pans and such from the oven
Top quality gloves!!! This is a great product!!  Super quality!!!  I tend to pre heat my oven and THEN realize the oven rack is not the right height.  Two of these make it so much easier to correct this than the awkward one-handed method with a quilted mitt.  Lifting a hot heavy casserole with a PAIR of these gloves is so much easier and I feel NO HEAT through them. And I use cast iron cookware quite often so, again much easier and the silicone gives me a no-slip grip!!  I bought three of these.  Will make a great gift.  And haven't even gotten to the grill with these yet!!  Great job, Kitchen Ready!!!
NO MORE BURNED HANDS!!! These gloves work great.  I purchased them because I was tired of burning my hands with old worn out oven mitts.  These glove fit perfectly and protect my whole hand and provide a firm grip on the dishes you are handling.  Can't recommend them enough!!
Well worth the price! These gloves are everything that they say they are. I cooked pizza on my treager grill and I just reached in and pulled the pizza out and didn't even feel warm inside the gloves. I highly recommend these for all cooking.
Five Stars Love them, know now I won't burn my wrists...thank you again for the wonderful price...
Five Stars All I can say is LOVE LOVE LOVE these gloves!  No more pot holders!
Five Stars These work way better than a pot holder!
Five Stars Great buy love them
Superb Nice fit
Heat resistance temp not what was advertised I pulled a pan off the grill to take upstairs. Temp was around 550 degrees. Almost didn’t make it. The gloves were tested to 900+ degrees, but did not protect as advertised.
Very surprised I was skeptical about these at first but they work perfectly. I can grab trays and dishes right out of the oven without the weirdness of a mit. I love being able to properly grip the hot dish with these. They are also super comfortable, which surprised me. And lastly they are wash machine safe so keeping them clean is super easy
Heat proof for sure. You don’t feel a thing while wearing theses gloves. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have small hands and didn’t realize how large they are.
Ideal grilling glove I love to grill and have always preferred to work without our gloves. These are very comfortable, protective, and have a very nice grip. I’ve used them cooking over the fire which they’re ideal for and on the grill when smoking. I feel very safe around the heat and flame with these gloves on.  I now prefer to grill with these
Makes baking easier You won’t burn yourself as often and certainly not where the gloves are.  Great product for bakers.
Love these Gloves Have been using the others and found these. Love that they come with both hands since you need 2. I have used them for the cooking in the house and out on the Grill/Smoker. they are the best I would recommend them to anyone.Remember they are not for picking up hot leaking liquids since that will soak into the gloves. they are made to pick up Hot pans and trays and transport to Kitchen. We even put them under the hot items on the table if needed.Love the Gloves!
Works 350-500F oven temp but too big for hands Definitely heat resistant. Hv used them at 350-500 F degrees in getting casserole from ovenCon:: gloves are exceptionally large.  I hv somewhat large hands and gloves are too big, must hv been made with men in mind :-(
too big i guess its for larger hands
Ooooo She Thick. A little too thick for cooking. Wish they were a little thinner then I think they’d be great.
Functional These gloves are functional but I do have one gripe. The inside lining gets bunched a bit on a couple fingers consistently so getting them on fully is not as quick as I'd like. That said they work in keeping fingers and wrists from getting burned so still a four star product.
Essential I gave as a gift. He loves them.
A great purchase. Totally satisfied with this product. I received these today and they are going to work perfectly to protect my hands and wrists from oven burns. They fit very well when you pull them on snugly. The fingers of the gloves hug your fingers so that they do not slip and get loose. A great product. A very happy purchase. These would make a very nice gift for someone that does a lot of baking....or barbecuing.
Not as good as I’ve glove Does not stand up to heat as well as the ice glove . I would not recommend
The KitchenReady Gloves have a nice feel with a solid grip I purchased KitchenReady's Safe Grip Heat Resistant Oven Gloves to use with my Big Green Egg. They more than exceeded my expectations! With cooking temperatures between 400-700 degrees - depending on what I'm cooking - I feel very safe using these Gloves. In the past I have used bulky oven mitts. The KitchenReady Gloves have a nice feel with a solid grip. Nice work KitchenReady, I look forward to what you come up with next!
Works Great We use it near our grill and with our oven.
Awesome! Great hot mitts, I can finally grab hot pots and pans with a firm and steady grip instead of an awkward lobster-like grip. They definitely keep your hands cool for long enough to get the job done. Echoing other reviews, just make sure you don't get hot liquid on them, they are definitely just meant for holding hot pots and pans.
Good for large hands My husband is a competitive smoker and needed large gloves. He loves these. They are great at keeping heat at bay and fits his large hands beautifully
Premium Cooking Gloves Just received the premium cooking gloves. Fit is snug and totally protects from the very hot heat of a cast iron Dutch oven at 450 degrees. Will make artisan bread baking a safer activity without the worry of being burnt when removing the baking vessel.
bought these for my daughter who is visually impaired and ... bought these for my daughter who is visually impaired and very afraid of the oven and stove top. She loves these and feels confident now when she is cooking or removing something from the oven that she will not be burned,
Does not fit a normal sized hand. The glove fingers are both too short (by about 3/4") and very tight in diameter. Removing the glove is like trying to get out of Chinese handcuffs.  My hands by the way are average in size -even my niece who has smaller hands had the same reaction.  Do the people who make items like this even try them out for basic fit?? back they go....
Great Fit!! I have pretty big hands for a female and was pleasantly surprised how well they fit.  I've used them a couple of times already since getting them yesterday and really feel like they are a much safer way to retrieve casseroles and pans out of a hot oven.
Great value Very nice
They do work well Need small medium and large sizes
Wish I had bought them sooner works great!  I love the way they not only insulate my hands better than oven mitts but allow me to grip things better rather it is getting a turkey out of the oven or a hot pizza stone.
Looked like great gloves just not for a woman's hand even ... Looked like great gloves just not for a woman's hand even though my hands are on the wide side. Had to return them.
They don't hold out the heat as well as we ... They don't hold out the heat as well as we had hoped. Also, if it gets wet, the heat goes right through the gloves
Five Stars The gloves are an excellent quality and at a very reasonable price. They came two days before promised.
Great Oven Gloves!!!! Great product.  Was very useful in keeping hands protected while carving a hot turkey.  Very comfortable and easy to launder.
Excellent Product Bought this as gift but know it works as description of product says it does.
Great for the kitchen! Wow! These are super and much better than pot holders.
Works great and protects my hands against heat Used them this past weekend to smoke a brisket. Works great and protects my hands against heat.
To bulky. Difficult to use because of bulkiness.
Doesn't work at all It wasn't Heat Resistant and burnedSo don't wast your money and looking for other Gloves
These gloves work great! No more burns when baking! These gloves are so awesome!!
Happy hands Love the safe grip gloves, so glad I got them
Five Stars they work great
Five Stars Love them!!
Five Stars Great gloves!!
No more burnt knuckles I must disclose that I received a discount on my purchase of these oven mitts,I am disabled and sometimes I touch the side of my oven when trying to get heavier and when  I am using my broiler I always burn my knuckles.I broiled some pork steaks tonight and used my new mitts, No burnt knuckles. Maybe now all the burns on my hands will heal.These will also be great for handling bread pans.I also want to mention that the packaging of these are very nice. And that would make a great gift for someone like me that gets burnt.Thank you
Essential for any Kitchen I'm not sure I've ever had a favorite  when it comes to kitchen mitts. However, if I were to have a favorite this would be it. These oven mitts fit very very well. I feel no heat taking a pan out of the oven that's been in there at 450° for several hours.
Use them all the time! My father got me these for Christmas and they are fantastic! We use them when baking and smoking meats. They make it very easy to grab whatever you need and we have not had any burning issues. I would highly recommend to anyone as these are something you would never think to own, but if you do, you will use them all the time!
Safe Family Cooking and Campfires Love these for safety in the kitchen and by camp fires.  My 12 year old likes to cook and uses them all the time too.  I would not feel this way with our old traditional hot pads.  These are great!
Five Stars They work great. I love them!
