        "- Shipping packaging\n",
        "- Product condition and damage\n",

        "\n",
        "2- Comments about pricing or availability:\n",
        "It's OK to comment on price if it's related to the product's value. For example, \"For only $29, this blender is really great.\"\n",
        "Pricing comments related to someone's individual experience aren't allowed. For example, \"Found this here for $5 less than at my local store.\"\n",

        "Supported languages are English and Spanish.\n",
        "To ensure that content is useful, we only allow it to be written in the supported language(s) of the Amazon site where it will appear. For example, we don't allow reviews written in French on Amazon.com. It only supports English and Spanish. Some Amazon sites support multiple languages, but content written in a mix of languages isn't allowed.\n",

        "Don't offer, request, or accept compensation for creating, editing, or posting content. Compensations include free and discounted products, refunds, and reimbursements. Don't try to manipulate the Amazon Verified Purchase badge by offering reviewers special pricing or reimbursements.\n",

However, brands or businesses can’t participate in the community in ways that divert Amazon customers to non-Amazon websites, applications, services, or channels. This includes ads, special offers, and “calls to action” used to conduct marketing or sales transactions. If you post content about your own products or services through a brand, seller, author, or artist account, additional labeling isn’t necessary.\n",
        "- Authors and publishers can continue to give readers free or discounted copies of their books if they don't require a review in exchange or try to influence the review.\n",

        "Only post your own content or content you have permission to use on Amazon. This includes text, images, and videos. You're not allowed to:\n",
        "- Post content that infringes on others' intellectual property (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets) or other proprietary rights\n",
